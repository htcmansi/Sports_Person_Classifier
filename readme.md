1. Maria Sharapova
2. Serena Williams
3. Virat Kohli
4. Roger Federer
5. Lionel Messi


Here is the folder structure,

- server: Python flask server
- model: Contains python notebook for model building
- images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training

## Technologies used in this project,

1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. visual studio code
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
